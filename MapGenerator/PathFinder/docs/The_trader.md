There needs to be a concept of the trader.
He will need to be neutral to anything that is a civilation and trades with every settlement.

This is a simulation, can someone on land travel from one civilization (towm, city or settlement)
And if not, we need to clear a path or build a bridge.

This is going to run after WorldFeatures.

And I think I'm going to want WorldFeatures to be simple natural featuers.
Where the Pathfinder will be building infrastructure or clearing nature to get to an area.

The trader isn't real, we can just say maybe he was an ancient trader and is long dead but the
procedural generation we need to simulate needs to be real.

please generate a context.md
and a readme.md doc or any other documented needed to build this module later.
